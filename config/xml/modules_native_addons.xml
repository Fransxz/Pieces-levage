Here are some of these potential benefits:Customer base expansion: By accepting payments in cryptocurrencies, merchants can attract customers who prefer to use digital currencies to make online purchases. This can help expand the potential customer base and increase sales.Reduced transaction fees: Cryptocurrency payments typically involve lower transaction fees than traditional credit card or bank transfer payments. Merchants can therefore save money on transaction fees and increase their profit margin.Increased security: Cryptocurrency payments are encrypted and anonymous, which can help reduce the risks of fraud and theft of personal information. In addition, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, making it difficult for customers to dispute transactions after they have been made.Easier international transactions: Cryptocurrency payments are not subject to foreign exchange restrictions or conversion fees, making international transactions easier for both merchants and customers.Innovative image: Integrating cryptocurrency payment solutions can give merchants an innovative and forward-thinking image, which can help improve their reputation and positioning in the market.Commissions: The merchant has the possibility to set the coefficient of his commissions between 1% and 5%]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[]]></tab><version><![CDATA[2.0.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.6.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.1.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[0]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[0]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[0]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Official Partner"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-official-partner.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1583820-pprod/youpay.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1583820-pbig/youpay.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[91293]]></id><name><![CDATA[tooleamazonmarkettool]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Amazon Market Tool]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Marketplaces]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Amazon Market Tool, will export your catalog, handle your Prime, MFN and FBA stock, prices and process orders with matched shipping templates.

Use GPT-4 artificial intelligence to assist you in the creation and translation of product descriptions, categories and CMS pages. Keep control over AI-generated content.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[The daily task of writing product descriptions can be tedious and time-consuming. And we know that your time is precious. That&#39;s why we&#39;re providing you with an e-commerce co-pilot that will help you create the best possible, SEO-optimized descriptions in the shortest possible time.&nbsp;Our &quot;E-commerce Copilot&quot; module lets you use the power of GPT-4 artificial intelligence to generate your product and category descriptions, as well as the content of your CMS pages. Don&#39;t spend hours manually writing your product descriptions: team up with a qualified partner and save time every day!&nbsp;SAVE TIME EVERY DAY&nbsp;The module installs&nbsp;an e-commerce content writing wizard&nbsp;on your PrestaShop store, saving you time every day: choose the type of content you want to write (short, long or meta description of a product or category, CMS page content), ask the AI to generate it, proofread it, modify it if necessary, then save! In just a few clicks, you&#39;ll have a complete, SEO-optimized text with minimum effort. In the same way, you can ask GPT-4 to translate content into any of your store&#39;s languages.We&#39;ve already drawn up prompts for you to send to GPT-4, so that you can start using the module as soon as it&#39;s installed, and save time in the process. However, if for any reason you&#39;d like to write your own prompts, you can! A tab in the module configuration is dedicated to customizing prompts.Finally, there&#39;s no need to go outside the product creation forms to use AI: we&#39;ve integrated the tool for generating and translating product descriptions directly within the forms. This allows you to enlist the help of your co-pilot directly during the product creation process! You can also call on your e-commerce assistant at any time, wherever you are in the back office of your PrestaShop store. The AI can be accessed directly via a menu section in your PrestaShop store.&nbsp;KEEP CONTROL OVER THE QUALITY OF YOUR CONTENT&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence is powerful, but it can&#39;t completely replace you. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve made it a point of honor to let you control the content generated, ensuring that the text is consistent and perfectly reflects your vision and the style of your store. Once your approval has been obtained, the module automatically saves the new texts or translations.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[i18n_localization]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.6.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.1.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[0]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[0]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[0]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Official Partner"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-official-partner.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1602584-pprod/e-commerce-copilot-generate-translate-with-chatgpt4.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1602584-pbig/e-commerce-copilot-generate-translate-with-chatgpt4.jpg]]></big></cover></module></modules>
